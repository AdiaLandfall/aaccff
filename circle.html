              While the gathering of individuals known as The Blue are made up
              of a diverse people, there are stripes that can be painted broad
              across them all. For such detail, and to provide an
              introduction:</p>

            <h2>Eidenae <span class="luceren">(History)</span> </h2>
            <p class="narrative">
              The Blue are not native to the star of Etheirys. While their
              origins remain mysterious for the very most part, a simple recount
              is possible. Five years after the Calamity of the Seventh Umbral
              Era, a strange Viera woman arrived on Lominsan shores: one Adia.
              Months later, and separated by months each, others arrived, and
              the Circle grew slowly to its current size. The Blue are
              undoubtedly borne collectively of another place, one with names,
              places, and a complex history.</p>

            <h2>Gravae <span class="luceren">(Hooks)</span> </h2>
            <p class="narrative">
              The Blue will, nominally, speak with anyone. Each member takes
              pride or interest in their own topics, yet generally they will
              accept the greeting of a stranger without issue. While some are
              new and adjusting, most are well versed and storied, with their
              own views on events since their arrival. They will take great
              interest in anyone who is, like them, not native to Etheirys.
              Those brave of spirit and open of mind will find their tales of
              foreign magicks, strange technologies, and odd places to be quite
              exciting. If you have an adventure to share, a narrative to
              retell, or a curiosity to dangle, The Blue will answer the
              call.</p>
              
            <!-- Concrete (OOC)-->
            <h2>Crescerae <span class="luceren">(OOC)</span> </h2>
            <p class="narrative">              
              The Blue are a reflection of a sincere, literal "circle" or
              "system" of several conscious individuals, sharing a single brain.
              This phenomena is often referred to as "a plural person", or an
              expression of "DID". The themes, processes, and realities of such
              a group tend to be expressed through both language and action
              while enjoying the glorious realm of Eorzea, and beyond.</p>
